Calculating country and location-specific biodiversity footprints for food using a combination of FAO stat consumption data, Resource Trade Earth data, and BIOVALENT footprint values.
Example is using reference year 2022 and data from Brazil. R code explains how to calculate 'foodprints' for any country, all that needs to be changed is the FAOSTAT and Resource Trade Earth source files (instructions provided). 

BIOVALENT values are taken from the Biodiversity Footprint Database https://zenodo.org/records/8369650. Biodiversity impact values are calculated using LC-IMPACT and Characterisation Factors from Poore and Nemecek (2018): https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.aaq0216.
