Calculating country and location-specific biodiversity footprints for food using a combination of FAO stat consumption data (provided by Hot or Cool), Resource Trade Earth data, and BIOVALENT footprint values.
Example is using reference year 2022 and data from Brazil. R code explains how to calculate 'foodprints' for any country, all that needs to be changed is the FAOSTAT and Resource Trade Earth source files (instructions provided). 

BIOVALENT values are taken from the Biodiversity Footprint Database https://zenodo.org/records/8369650.

FAOSTAT data is publicly available online at https://www.fao.org/faostat/en/#data/FBS. 

Resource Trade Earth data is publicly available at https://resourcetrade.earth/.
